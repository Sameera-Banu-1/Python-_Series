# Python-_Series
A comprehensive Python practice series where I explore and implement Python programs, mini-projects, and concepts. This repository is dedicated to enhancing my Python skills through hands-on coding and continuous learning.

<1> **Calculator-OOP'S**

--> This project is a Python-based calculator built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The program supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with       each function implemented as a method inside the Calculator class. The design uses a dictionary to map operation names to their respective methods, allowing dynamic function calls and a menu-driven interface for     easy user interaction. Proper input handling ensures that only numeric values are accepted, and division-by-zero cases are handled gracefully with clear error messages.

-->The calculator showcases encapsulation by grouping related operations within a single class and demonstrates method calling using self. The code follows clean, readable practices, making it easy to understand and    maintain. It continuously runs until the user chooses to exit, improving usability. Overall, this project serves as a practical example of applying Python OOP principles to solve real-world problems while            maintaining flexibility for future improvements.
